# 1. Write a Python program to swap two variables without using a third variable.
# a = 10
# b = 20

# print("a = ",a ,"b = ", b) 

# a,b = b,a
# print("a = ",a ,"b = ", b) 


# 2.Create a program that takes your name and age as input and prints them in a sentence.

# name = input("Enter your Name :")
# age = int(input("Enter your age :"))

# print("Hello ",name, "you age",age) 

# 3.Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle using user input for length and width.

# length = int(input("Enter length :"))
# width = int(input("Enter length :"))

# rec = length * width 

# print("Area of Rectangle", rec)

# 4.Store your favorite movie name, release year, and rating in variables and print them in a formatted string.

# movie_name = input("Enter Your Favorite movie Name :")
# release_year = int(input("Enter Your Favorite movie year :"))
# Rating = input("Enter rating of your Favorite movie :")

# print( "Your Favorite movie is ",movie_name,"in",release_year," it was reasised you rated it",Rating,)


# 5.Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

# cal = int(input("enter cal"))
# far = cal * (9 / 5)
# print(cal)
# print(far)

# 6.Take input from the user and check its data type using type().

# var = input("Enter string  value")
# print(type(var))
# var1 = int(input("Enter any int value"))
# print(type(var1))
# var2 = float(input("Enter any floate"))
# print(type(var2))
# var3 = bool(input("Enter any bool"))
# print(type(var3))

# 7.Write a program that accepts two integers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# num1= int(input("Enter a number one for Sum "))
# num2= int(input("Enter a number second for Sum "))

# sum1 = num1 + num2 # or print = (num1 + num2)
# print(sum1)

# print(num1 - num2)
# print(num1 * num2)
# print(num1 / num2)

# 8.Create a program that checks whether a given number is even or odd.
num1 = int(input("Enter the number to find reather its even or odd :"))
